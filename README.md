# phylotree

`ami-phylo` analyses images and diagrams to extract phylogenetic trees. This is a complete repository of the analysis of ca 4500 files from IJSEM, carried out as Open Notebook Science. The intention is that everything in the analysis is either accessible here or should be Open and linked from here.

Main headings are:

## description of the workflow

## specification of files, errors, protocols

## input and output files (large)

## errors
